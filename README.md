This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Idea

A Single Page Application Forum created for posting opinions and experience about a topic, event, place, etc...

## Accessibility 

### Guest users
Guest users have access to login and register page, as well as the 3 most liked posts.

### Authenticated users
Authenticated users have access to all posts, seacrh posts by keyword, category, likes etc. Can write and like posts and reply to posts,
change avatar picture. Also can see more posts details and user profiles.
## Implementation
The app uses React's Context API and cookies for authentication; functional and class components; react-router-dom for the front-end navigation; react-notifications-component for error handling or successful actions.
